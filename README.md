# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
This repository contains the theoretical foundations and implementations of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms. 
The content focuses exclusively on classical DSA concepts typically taught in computer science courses, including searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, linked lists, tree structures, graph representations, traversal techniques, and basic operations.

### 1. Searching Algorithms
This section includes the core searching techniques used to locate elements within data collections. Each algorithm includes its working principle, time complexity, and use cases.
##### 1.1 Linear Search
Sequentially checks each element in the list until the target element is found.
##### 1.2 Binary Search
Efficient search on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### 2. Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order, typically ascending or descending. Both comparison-based and non-comparison-based methods are included.
##### 2.1 Bubble Sort
Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements.
##### 2.2 Selection Sort
Finds the minimum element and places it at the correct position after each iteration.
##### 2.3 Insertion Sort
Builds a sorted array by inserting elements one at a time into their correct position.
##### 2.4 Merge Sort
Divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list, sorts each half, and merges them.
##### 2.5 Quick Sort
Partitions the array around a pivot and recursively sorts subarrays.

### 3. Linked List
This section contains the conceptual and operational details of the linked list data structure.
##### 3.1 Singly Linked List
Nodes contain data and a pointer to the next node.
##### 3.2 Doubly Linked List
Each node holds pointers to both previous and next nodes.
##### 3.3 Circular Linked List
Last node points back to the first, forming a circular chain.
##### 3.4 Operations
Insertion at beginning, end, or any position
Deletion from beginning, end, or any position
Searching for an element in the list
Reversal of the list (iterative and recursive methods)
Loop detection and removal

### 4. Trees
The repository includes classical tree structures, operations, and traversal methods.
##### 4.1 Binary Tree
Hierarchical structure with at most two children per node.
##### 4.2 Binary Search Tree (BST)
Binary tree that maintains ordered structure to allow efficient search, insert, and delete operations.
##### 4.3 Threaded Binary Tree
Enhanced binary tree where null pointers are replaced with references to the inorder predecessor or successor to improve traversal efficiency.
##### 4.4 Tree Traversals
Inorder Traversal
Preorder Traversal
Postorder Traversal
Depth-First Search (Non-Recursive) using stack
Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search)

### 5. Graphs
This section explores the representation and traversal of graphs, along with basic graph algorithms.
##### 5.1 Graph Representation
Adjacency List Representation
Adjacency Matrix Representation
##### 5.2 Graph Operations
Insertion of vertices
Deletion of vertices
Insertion of edges
Deletion of edges
##### 5.3 Graph Traversal Algorithms
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Depth-First Search Without Recursion (using stack)
##### 5.4 Minimum Spanning Tree
Prim’s Algorithm (selects edges based on minimum weight from connected components)


### Purpose of This Repository
